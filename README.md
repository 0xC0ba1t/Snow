# Snow
An open source performance CPU (Test/Experiment)

Sup, Work is finally going to begin on Snow, as I am having vacation.

I'm planning for v1 to use my own core, in development known as Quantum, and then slowly work my way up.

Original version is going to be designed in logisim, then maybe later on in Intel Quartus.
